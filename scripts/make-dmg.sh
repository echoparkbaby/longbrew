Longbrew has to be in your Applications folder before it will work.

Why: it installs a small helper to change your Mac's sleep settings, and macOS
refuses to register that helper from a disk image or a folder that can move.
Longbrew will tell you the same thing if you try to run it from here.

  1. Drag Longbrew to the Applications folder in this window.
  2. Open it from Applications (not from this disk image).
  3. Click the lightning-bolt menu -> Install Privileged Helper...
  4. Approve "Longbrew" in System Settings -> General ->
     Login Items & Extensions -> Allow in the Background.

Then use "Keep Awake With Lid Closed" and shut the lid.
