// ON  = `pmset -a disablesleep 1`  → Mac stays awake with the lid closed.
// OFF = `pmset -a disablesleep 0`  → normal behaviour restored.

// LaunchDaemon registered with SMAppService and reached over XPC — macOS shows its
// own approval UI, so there's no sudoers file and no Terminal step. Both ends pin
